# Recursive Loop
While looping is great, it's not the only way to iterate.  In fact, looping is frowned upon in Functional Programming.  A functional language such as Haskell doesn't even have [loops](https://ggbaker.ca/prog-langs/content/functional.html)!  It might be hard to believe, but you don't really need loops if you have recursion.  

This challenge will give you a taste of what life would be like without loops.

## Requirements
1. Write a function that takes an integer.  The function should print all the integers from 0 to the integer.
2. Same thing, but count down to 0.
