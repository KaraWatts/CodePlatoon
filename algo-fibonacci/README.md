# Fibonacci Sequence

One of the most popular coding challenges is to write an algorithm to return the `n-th` element in the Fibonacci sequence. Officially, the Fibonacci sequence is the integer sequence defined by the recurrence relation: `F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)`, where `F(0) = 0` and `F(1) = 1`. For those of us who aren't math whizzes, the nth Fibonacci number is the sum of the prior two Fibonacci numbers.

Below are the first few values of the sequence:

```
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144...
```

Your challenge today is to write an algorithm that, given a number `n`, return the n-th Fibonacci Number. Keep in mind that the first two numbers in the fibonacci sequence are always [0,1]

Examples:

```js
fibonacci(3); // 2
fibonacci(7); // 13
```

## Usage

To install the pre-defined dependencies (including Jest)

```sh
npm install
```

To run just `fibonacci.js`

```sh
npm start
```

To run Jest

```sh
npm test
```
