  "description": "One of the most popular coding challenges is to write an algorithm to return the `n-th` element in the Fibonacci sequence. Officially, the Fibonacci sequence is the integer sequence defined by the recurrence relation: `F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)`, where `F(0) = 0` and `F(1) = 1`. For those of us who aren't math whizzes, the nth Fibonacci number is the sum of the prior two Fibonacci numbers.",
