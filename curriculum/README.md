## Asking Questions in Slack / Slack Etiquette

Before anything, read through [Slack etiquette](https://slack.com/blog/collaboration/etiquette-tips-in-slack).

Questions should be asked in the #questions Slack channel using proper [formatting](https://slack.com/help/articles/202288908-Format-your-messages) (see Inline code section), not via TA or instructor DM. This reflects the industry norms - companies want their engineers to have discussions publicly so that questions can be easily searched and referenced.

Your questions should be pointed (not "Can someone help me?"), show that youâ€™ve read through the code/error, should contain your thought process / some potential solutions, and should not be anything that is easily Google-able. Once you ask a question and find a solution, please update your question thread so that other students can benefit from seeing the question and answer.

## What should I do if I finish everything on any given day?

1. Help those around you. Teaching solidifies learning.
2. Watch tomorrow's video to get yourself a leg up on the next day!
3. Go through [Code Wars](https://www.codewars.com/)
4. Visit [Pramp](https://www.pramp.com/promo/codeplatoon) to interview with other people - we have an agreement with them to get their premium plan for free!
5. [Interview Cake](https://www.interviewcake.com/)

## Video Links

Classroom videos/lectures will be recorded and posted to YouTube. It can take up to a few hours to process the video after recording, so please be patient if you don't see the video available online immediately after a lecture. If you want to refer back to the lecture content before the video is uploaded, you can look at the demo code in github, which is uploaded immediately after lectures finish.
