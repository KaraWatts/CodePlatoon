# Schema Design

## What are we trying to accomplish?

By learning SQL schema design, we aim to acquire the skills necessary for creating well-structured and efficient database architectures. Understanding the principles of normalization, proper use of primary and foreign keys, data types, and indexing allows us to design databases that ensure data integrity, performance, and ease of maintenance. This knowledge equips us to strike a balance between normalization and optimization, considering the specific needs of applications. Additionally, gaining proficiency in turning schema designs into SQL tables and running SQL files in PostgreSQL provides practical skills for implementing and managing databases. The ability to design effective database schemas, comprehend entity fields in PostgreSQL, and recognize various relationship types enables me to address real-world scenarios and build robust systems. Ultimately, these subjects empower me to create, manage, and optimize databases effectively, contributing to the development of scalable and efficient software solutions.
