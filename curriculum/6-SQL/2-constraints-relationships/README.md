# Constraints and Relationships

## What are we trying to accomplish?

By learning about relationships and constraints in database management, you are striving to gain a comprehensive understanding of how to design and structure databases effectively. Relationships guide the connections between different entities, mirroring real-world scenarios, and ensuring data accuracy. Constraints, on the other hand, act as safeguards to maintain data integrity by imposing rules on the allowed values. Together, mastering relationships and constraints empowers you to create well-organized, reliable databases that accurately represent and adhere to real-world scenarios, enhancing the efficiency, security, and robustness of your data management systems.
