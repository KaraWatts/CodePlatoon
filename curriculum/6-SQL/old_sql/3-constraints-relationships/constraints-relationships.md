# Constraints and Relationships

A database constraint is effectively a rule (or limitation) that we add to a column or multiple columns for a table. These help us create proper relationships without worrying about invalid data. There are several types of constraints that we can add (see: [constraints](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/ddl-constraints.html)) to our tables.

To start, let's focus on:

- Primary Keys
- Foreign Keys
- The `UNIQUE` constraint

## Primay and Foreign Keys are Constraints

You may have seen primary/foreign keys already. Let's briefly review them and discuss how they *enforce* (i.e. constrain) relationships in our data.


- Primary Key (PK)
  - Establishes the main (i.e. primary) unique identification column(s) for a table's records
  - Every table in a relational database should have a PK
  - PK column values can't be NULL

```sql
CREATE TABLE professors (
  id serial PRIMARY KEY,
  ...
);
```

- Foreign Key (FK)
  - Establishes column(s) whose values references (i.e. matches) a PK in another table (common), or even in the same table (rare)
  - FK column values can be NULL ("orphaned record")

```sql
CREATE TABLE courses (
  ...
  professor_id integer REFERENCES professors (id),
);
```

...or...

```sql
CREATE TABLE courses (
  ...
  professor_id integer
);

ALTER TABLE courses
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_course_professors
FOREIGN KEY (professor_id)
REFERENCES professors (id);
```

## The `UNIQUE` constraint

- Unique Key (UQ)
  - Establishes column(s) whose values must be unique across all records
  - UQ column values can be NULL

```sql
CREATE TABLE lockers (
  ...
  user_id integer UNIQUE,
);
```

## Relationships

To review, entities (i.e. tables) in our database can have one of three main relationships with one another:

- One-to-One
  - A relationship where AT MOST one record from Table-A can ever be referenced by a record from Table-B
  - This is usually a rare relationship to find in most database models
  - This is achieved in one of two ways:
    - A primary key + foreign key
    - A foreign key + unique key
- One-To-Many
  - A relationship where one record from Table-A may be referenced by one or more records from Table-B
  - This is achieved by creating a foreign key on a column in Table-B, to reference the PK in Table-A
- Many-To-Many
  - A relationship where a record from Table-A may be associated with one or more records from Table-B, and a record from Table-B may be associated with one or more records from Table-A
  - This is achieved by creating a join table (a.k.a. a through table)

### Database Schema Design

Let's use Facebook as a simple example to understand how to create a database schema that satisfies our needs, and incorporates using some of the constraints and relationships we talked about above. We're going to try to model the concept of having users who can write posts, write comments, or react to posts on Facebook. Here are the main tables we would need to create:

| **user_accounts** |
| ----------------- |
| id                |
| username          |
| password          |
| last_login_date   |

| **user_profiles** |
| ----------------- |
| id                |
| user_id           |
| profile_photo_url |
| about_me          |
| personal_quote    |

| **posts** |
| --------- |
| id        |
| content   |
| user_id   |

| **comments** |
| ------------ |
| id           |
| content      |
| user_id      |
| post_id      |

**reaction_types**
---|
id |
type |

Now let's talk about some relationships that we'd want to establish here between our tables...

**What is the relationship between `user_accounts` and `user_profiles`?**

...Can a user have more than one profile? **No.**  
...Can a profile have more than one user? **No.**

This is a one-to-one relationship!

- _Solution:_ Create a FK + UQ constraint for column `user_id` in table `user_profiles`

**What is the relationship between `user_accounts` and `posts`?**

...Can a user create more than one post? **Yes.**  
...Can a post be created by more than one user? **No.**

This is a one-to-many relationship!

- _Solution:_ Create a FK constraint for column-`user_id` in table-`posts`

**What is the relationship between `posts` and `reaction_types`?**

...Can a post have more than one reaction (i.e. "LIKE")? **Yes.**  
...Can a reaction ("LIKE") be made to more than posts? **Yes.**

This is a many-to-many relationship!

- _Solution:_ Create a new **join table** (using FKs) between table-`posts` and table-`reaction_types`, called table-`post_reactions`:

**post_reactions**
---|
id |
post_id |
reaction_id |
user_id |

In this new table, column-`post_id` would have a FK to table-`posts`, column-`reaction_id` would have a FK to table-`reaction_types`, and colunm-`user_id` would have a FK to table-`user_accounts`.

Additionally, we may want to create a UQ for column-`post_id` + column-`user_id` because the same user is not allowed to have multiple reactions to the same post.
