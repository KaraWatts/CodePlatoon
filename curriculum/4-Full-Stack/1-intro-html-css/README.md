# HTML & CSS

## What are we Trying to Accomplish?

By learning HTML and CSS, you are equipping yourself with the foundational skills needed to create and design web content. HTML, as the markup language, provides the structural backbone for web pages, allowing you to organize and present content effectively. CSS complements HTML by enabling you to style and format web elements, ensuring a visually appealing and consistent user experience. These essential skills are the building blocks of web development and design, empowering you to craft responsive, accessible, and aesthetically pleasing websites, and enabling you to pursue careers in web development, user interface design, and front-end engineering, or even to enhance your proficiency in various software-related roles.
