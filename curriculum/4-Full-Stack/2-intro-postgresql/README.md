# Intro to SQL, Relational Databases, and basic data schema design

## What are we trying to Accomplish?

By learning about Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS), you are aiming to acquire the knowledge and skills required to effectively and efficiently manage data. RDBMS provides a structured framework for organizing, storing, and retrieving data, ensuring data integrity and accuracy. This understanding enables you to design, create, and maintain databases that can store and manage vast amounts of information in a way that is accessible, secure, and optimized for efficient querying, thereby enabling you to make informed decisions, drive innovation, and effectively support applications and businesses that rely on data-driven insights.
