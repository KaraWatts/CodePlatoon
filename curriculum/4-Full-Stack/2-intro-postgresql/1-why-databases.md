## Introduction

Welcome to the lecture on "Why Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS)." In this session, we'll explore the importance of using databases and dive into the world of RDBMS. We'll discuss why databases are crucial, how data can be stored using CSV files in Python, and ultimately, the advantages of employing an RDBMS over traditional file-based data storage methods like CSV and JSON.

## 1. Why Databases?

### Importance of Data Management

In today's digital age, data has become a critical asset for organizations across the globe. According to an article from Forbes, "Data is the New Oil," they state that "data is the lifeblood of any organization" and that "those who control the data control the future." Data is no longer limited to tech companies; it plays a pivotal role in various industries, from healthcare to e-commerce. A report by Statista reveals that "in 2020, the worldwide data volume was predicted to grow 44 zettabytes per day by 2020," highlighting the sheer volume of data generated daily. Managing this valuable resource effectively is crucial for making informed decisions, gaining a competitive edge, and driving innovation in organizations.

### Challenges with Data

The exponential growth in data volume brings its set of challenges. Without a structured data management system, organizations can struggle to harness the full potential of their data. A report by TechRepublic emphasizes this, stating, "The explosion in data volume has left businesses struggling with data overload." It further notes that "unstructured data can be a problem for any company." The challenges extend beyond data volume; data quality, security, and compliance are also pressing concerns. Notably, Forbes mentions, "Gartner predicts that through 2022, only 20% of analytic insights will deliver business outcomes due to the challenges of data silos and data governance issues." This highlights the need for structured data management systems that can address these challenges effectively.

### Data Consistency

Maintaining data consistency, integrity, and reliability is paramount for any business or application. The Harvard Business Review discusses data consistency in an article titled "The Importance of Consistency in Data." It points out that "inconsistent data can lead to inaccurate analysis and undermine the value of even the most sophisticated business intelligence and analytics efforts." Inaccurate data can result in costly decisions and erode trust in an organization's information. A report from Experian Data Quality states that "83% of businesses believe their revenue is affected by inaccurate and incomplete customer or prospect data." To ensure reliable and consistent data, structured data management systems, like databases, play a pivotal role in maintaining data quality and integrity.

Certainly! Here's an extended section that includes a CSV file containing student information and a Python script with a `Student` class and a menu for viewing, adding, deleting students, and saving changes to the student CSV file:

## 2. Storing Data in CSV Files with Python

### Introduction to CSV Files

Comma-Separated Values (CSV) files are a popular choice for storing structured data. They are human-readable, simple to create, and widely supported in various applications. In CSV files, data is organized in rows and columns, with each line representing a record, and fields separated by commas. For example, consider a student information CSV file:

```csv
id,first_name,last_name,age,grade
1,John,Doe,18,A
2,Jane,Smith,19,B
3,Bob,Johnson,20,C
4,Emily,Williams,18,A
5,Michael,Brown,19,B
```

### Python's CSV Module

Python provides a built-in `csv` module that simplifies reading from and writing to CSV files. This module makes it straightforward to work with CSV data, including reading it into data structures and saving data back to CSV files.

### Example Code

Here's a Python script with a `Student` class and a menu system to perform operations on the student CSV file. The script allows you to view student information, add new students, delete students, and save changes back to the CSV file.

```python
import csv

class Student:
    def __init__(self, student_id, first_name, last_name, age, grade):
        self.id = student_id
        self.first_name = first_name
        self.last_name = last_name
        self.age = age
        self.grade = grade

def read_student_data(filename):
    students = []
    try:
        with open(filename, mode='r', newline='') as file:
            reader = csv.DictReader(file)
            for row in reader:
                student = Student(row['id'], row['first_name'], row['last_name'], row['age'], row['grade'])
                students.append(student)
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print("Student data file not found.")
    return students

def write_student_data(filename, students):
    with open(filename, mode='w', newline='') as file:
        writer = csv.writer(file)
        writer.writerow(['id', 'first_name', 'last_name', 'age', 'grade'])
        for student in students:
            writer.writerow([student.id, student.first_name, student.last_name, student.age, student.grade])

def main():
    filename = 'student_data.csv'
    students = read_student_data(filename)

    while True:
        print("\nStudent Management Menu:")
        print("1. View Student Information")
        print("2. Add Student")
        print("3. Delete Student")
        print("4. Exit")

        choice = input("Enter your choice: ")

        if choice == '1':
            # View Student Information
            for student in students:
                print(f"{student.id}: {student.first_name} {student.last_name}, Age: {student.age}, Grade: {student.grade}")

        elif choice == '2':
            # Add Student
            student_id = input("Enter Student ID: ")
            first_name = input("Enter First Name: ")
            last_name = input("Enter Last Name: ")
            age = input("Enter Age: ")
            grade = input("Enter Grade: ")
            new_student = Student(student_id, first_name, last_name, age, grade)
            students.append(new_student)
            write_student_data(filename, students)
            print("Student added successfully.")

        elif choice == '3':
            # Delete Student
            student_id = input("Enter Student ID to delete: ")
            students = [s for s in students if s.id != student_id]
            write_student_data(filename, students)
            print("Student deleted successfully.")

        elif choice == '4':
            # Exit
            print("Goodbye!")
            break

        else:
            print("Invalid choice. Please enter a valid option.")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```
