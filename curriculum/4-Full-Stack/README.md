# Intro to Full Stack Development

## What are we trying to accomplish?

By learning how to create a simple full stack app with Flask, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PostgreSQL, you aim to acquire a comprehensive set of skills to develop dynamic and interactive web applications. Flask serves as the backend framework, enabling you to handle server-side logic and database interactions with PostgreSQL. HTML and CSS provide the structure and styling for your front-end, while JavaScript adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to your user interface. This holistic approach equips you to design, build, and deploy functional web applications, giving you a solid foundation to understand both the frontend and backend components, and enabling you to bring your ideas to life in the digital realm.
