# HTTP and Fetch

## What are we trying to Accomplish?

By learning about HTTP, fetch, and promises, you aim to gain a fundamental understanding of how web communication functions and how to make network requests, such as fetching data from APIs, in a web application. This knowledge empowers you to create responsive and dynamic web experiences by handling asynchronous operations efficiently, ensuring that your application can interact with external data sources or services seamlessly, providing users with real-time updates and a smoother, more interactive web browsing experience.
