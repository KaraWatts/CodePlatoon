# Intro to Web - Servers (Flask)

## What are we trying to Accomplish?

By learning how to create a web server with Flask that can handle GET requests and query a PostgreSQL database to return a response, you are equipping yourself with the fundamental skills to build robust and dynamic web applications. This knowledge empowers you to develop interactive and data-driven web services, ranging from simple websites to complex web applications. It enables you to provide real-time access to data stored in a database, making it invaluable for creating applications that display, manipulate, and serve data to users, whether it's for displaying product information, managing user accounts, presenting analytics, or any other use case. Ultimately, this proficiency in web development using Flask and database integration opens up a world of possibilities for creating powerful, user-friendly, and scalable web solutions.
