# DS & ALGOS

## Plan

- Day 1: Simple vs Binary Search Algorithms
- Day 2: Big-O
- Day 3: Linked Lists
  - **Singly Linked Lists:**
    - Structure and implementation of singly linked lists.
    - Operations: insert, delete, search.
    - Time and space complexity analysis.
  - **Doubly Linked Lists:**
    - Understanding doubly linked lists.
    - Advantages and use cases.
    - Implementing operations in doubly linked lists.

- Day 4: Stacks and Queues
  - **Stacks:**
    - LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) principle.
    - Stack operations: push, pop, peek.
    - Applications and use cases.
  - **Queues:**
    - FIFO (First-In, First-Out) principle.
    - Queue operations: enqueue, dequeue, front.
    - Applications and use cases.

- Day 5: Trees
  - **Binary Trees:**
    - Understanding binary tree structure.
    - Traversal techniques: inorder, preorder, postorder.
    - Binary tree properties and applications.
  - **Binary Search Trees:**
    - Properties of BST.
    - Operations: search, insert, delete.
    - Balancing in AVL trees.
