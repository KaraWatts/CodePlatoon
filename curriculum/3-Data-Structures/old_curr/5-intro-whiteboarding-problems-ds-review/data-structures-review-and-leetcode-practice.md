# Review Day

## Topics Covered / Goals
- Data structures review
- Linked list implementation and iteration
- BST implementation and iteration

## Tutorial / Demo

Let's implement these together to review some of what we have learned.

### Linked Lists

- [Sort a linked list](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-list/)
- [Remove nodes from LL](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-nodes-from-linked-list/)

### Trees

- [Delete a node from a bst](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/delete-a-node-from-bst/1?utm_source=gfg&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=bottom_sticky_on_article)
- [Convert a sorted array to BST](https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-sorted-array-to-binary-search-tree/)

## Assignments
These exercises will likely need an account in leetcode / geeksforgeeks to run them in the browser

You may choose any exercises to work on and in any order. The goal is to practice using some of the new data structures

### Stacks
- [valid parentheses](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/)

### Linked Lists
- [Sort a linked list](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-list/)
- [Remove nodes from LL](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-nodes-from-linked-list/)
- [Reverse a LL](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/)
- [Swapping nodes in a LL](https://leetcode.com/problems/swapping-nodes-in-a-linked-list/)
- [Add two numbers](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/)

### Trees

These problems get more advanced
