# How to succeed at Whiteboarding Problems

1. Read the question out loud.
    - Ask questions along the way - don't make assumptions.
    - Take some notes:
        - Inputs
        - Outputs
        - Edge cases

2. Write pseudocode for a simplest case **solution**
    - Come up with very simple fake data  for your solution.

3. Talk through your pseudocode algorithm for our fake data.

4. Ask the interviewer if they have any thoughts, if that makes sense.

5. Implement! Write code for our simplest case solution.
    - Run code often as you go.
    - Work in very small chunks.
    - KEEP TALKING!!

6. Expand on our code, make it a full / complete solution.

7. Do a final "checklist" - make a list of:
    - edge cases
    - What the problem wants as output
    - any other gotchas

8. Talk thru the solution together.
