# Whiteboarding Problems & Technical Interviews, Data Structures Review

## What are we trying to accomplish?

You will learn and begin to practice the strategy to use to successfully solve whiteboarding / technical interview problems. It is also helpful as a general program design technique.

You will become more familiar with leetcode since there is a strong chance that in the interview process you will do a coding challenge or problem in leetcode or a similar tool.

Time permitting we will also do some Data Structures review.

## Instructor Notes & Prerequesites


If possible review data structures but the priority is introducing how to tackle whiteboarding problems. **Two instructors should demo doing a technical interview problem on leetcode.**

## Lectures & Assignments

0. [Lecture: Brief overview of the leetcode platform](./leetcode/README.md)

1. [Lecture: How to succeed at whiteboarding problems](./how-to-succeed-at-whiteboarding-problems.md)

    i. [**Here is a shorter "cheat sheet" for Whiteboarding Problems**](./whiteboarding-problems-cheat-sheet.md)

2. **In-class demo:** Instructors demo a technical interview - one interviews the other. Allocate approx. 20min for the problem and 5-10min for feedback. See [this list of leetcode problems](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nrFWrZSIDsGW3vUalt4zIqorE2xuRB5Au3zkMzNY-uQ/edit?usp=sharing) for some good candidates. The problem should be relatively simple and does **not** have to specifically be a Data Structures problem. The focus should be on the process.

3. **In-class exercise:** Students take 30 minutes to work on a simple leetcode problem from the list. Should **not** be a data structures problem - focus is in the process. Allocate approx. 10min for group feedback / discussion afterwards.

4. Assignment - Students do the Cassie's Data Structures Workshop Problems from [this list of leetcode problems](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nrFWrZSIDsGW3vUalt4zIqorE2xuRB5Au3zkMzNY-uQ/edit?usp=sharing).
    a. Try to finish all the "dictinaries", "arrays", and "strings" problems.

## TLO's (Testable Learning Objectives)

- Learn and able to apply the basic whiteboarding problem strategy.

## ELO's (Elective Learning Objectives)

- Can explain what the interviewer is looking for in a technical interview and what we are being evaluated on in a technical interview.
