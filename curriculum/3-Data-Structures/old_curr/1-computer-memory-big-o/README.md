# How Computer Memory Works, Arrays, and Big-O

## What are we trying to accomplish?

Today we are introducing concepts - how computer memory works, Arrays, complexity analysis and Big-O - that we will return to throughout the module. The concepts you learn today you will continue to use in this module to evaluate different kinds of programs and their performance tradeoffs.

This is also foundational knowledge which you will be expected to be familiar with in technical interviews, even if you don't use it on a daily basis at your job.

Lastly, these foundations will set you up to continue learning about computing and computer science after graduation in order to have a successful career.

## Instructor Notes & Prerequesites

"How computer memory works & arrays" is a lightweight introduction to computer memory and arrays intended to give context on why data structures likes stacks, queues, and linked lists (which the students will see in future lessons) were created to begin with.

"Intro to complexity analysis" is a lightweight introduction to the concept of time and space complexity intended to prepare students for the "Intro to Big-O" lecture which follows it."

"Intro to Big O" is intended to be a solid introduction to Big O along with practical examples and should be the focus and culmination of the lesson; it should probably take about half of the total time. The other lectures are intended to be preambles for it.

## Lectures & Assignments

1. [Lecture - How computer memory works & arrays](./1-how-memory-works-arrays.md)

    - [Assignment - Arrays - Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)

    - [Assignment - Arrays - Search Insert Position](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-insert-position/) (ignore the desired complexity of `O(log n))`)

    - Assignment - Bonus: if you have time, explore more Leetcode array problems. Stick to 'easy' problems for now (they are hard enough), but it can be a good way to learn about what types of data structures are out there, as there are many more then our program can cover in this week.  *Note: we recognize even the 'easy' problems are not that easy. We want you to get more familiar with Leetcode and what these kinds of challenges involve. The problems often seem contrived but they are a kind of exercise designed to stretch the muscles of your programming brain.*

2. [Lecture - Intro to Complexity Analysis: time complexity, space complexity](./2-intro-complexity-analysis.md)

3. [Lecture - Intro to Big-O](./3-intro-big-o.md)

    - [Assignment - Big O Problems 1](https://github.com/Code-Platoon-Assignments/algo-big-o-i)

    - [Assignment - Bubble Sort](https://github.com/Code-Platoon-Assignments/algo-bubble-sort) in Python - > This one will receive feedback from TAs

Optional - [Lecture - More Big O](./more-big-o.md). This reviews the same ground as the Intro to Big O lecture but in a different way and goes a bit more in depth.
