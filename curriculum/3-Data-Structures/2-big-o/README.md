# Big O Notation

## What are we trying to accomplish?

By learning about Big-O notation and understanding logarithms, you aim to gain a fundamental understanding of algorithmic efficiency and scalability. Big-O notation provides a concise way to express and analyze the worst-case time and space complexities of algorithms, allowing you to assess their performance as input sizes grow. Reading logarithms is crucial as they frequently appear in time complexities, especially in divide-and-conquer algorithms, helping you comprehend how algorithms scale in different scenarios. This knowledge empowers you to make informed decisions when selecting or designing algorithms, ensuring that you can choose the most suitable solutions for a given problem, taking into account both time and space efficiency.
