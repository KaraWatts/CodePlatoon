# Intro to CRUD

## What are we trying to accomplish?

By learning about CRUD operations and RESTful API design while building a Pokedex clone API, you are aiming to create a robust and user-friendly API that allows for efficient management of Pokemon data. CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) form the fundamental actions needed to interact with data, enabling you to add new Pokemon, retrieve their information, update their details, and remove them when necessary. RESTful API design principles ensure that your API is structured in a logical and standardized manner, making it easy for developers to understand, use, and extend. This knowledge empowers you to build an API that seamlessly integrates with various applications, providing a consistent and intuitive interface for users and developers to interact with Pokemon data, fostering interoperability and scalability.
