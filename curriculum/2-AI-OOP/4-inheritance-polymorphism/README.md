# Intro to Object Oriented Programming Inheritance and Polymorphism

## What are we trying to accomplish?

By learning inheritance and polymorphism in Python object-oriented programming (OOP), you are gaining the skills necessary to create more organized, modular, and reusable code. Inheritance allows you to create specialized classes that inherit attributes and behaviors from parent classes, reducing code duplication and promoting a hierarchical structure. Polymorphism enables you to design code that can work with different classes through a common interface, promoting flexibility and adaptability in your applications. Ultimately, mastering these concepts enhances your ability to create efficient, scalable, and maintainable Python programs.
