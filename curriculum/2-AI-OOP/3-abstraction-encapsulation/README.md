# Intro to Object Oriented Programming Encapsulation and Abstraction

## What are we trying to accomplish?

Learning the difference between class and instance attributes, as well as understanding class, instance, and static methods, is crucial for developing effective and well-structured object-oriented programming (OOP) code. By the end of this lesson you'll have mastered the distinction between class and instance attributes and understanding class, instance, and static methods empowers you to design efficient, maintainable, and adaptable code.
