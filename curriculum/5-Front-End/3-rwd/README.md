# Responsive Web Design with React

## What are we Trying to Accomplish?

By learning topics such as Display, Position, Z-index, Float, Overflow, Pseudo Classes, and Responsive Web Design (RWD), you aim to acquire the essential skills and knowledge necessary to create dynamic and adaptable web layouts. These concepts enable you to control the structure and appearance of web elements, control their positioning, manage layering, and apply responsive design techniques to ensure your websites can accommodate diverse device sizes, input methods, and data network constraints. Responsive Web Design involves employing approaches like progressive enhancement and graceful degradation, while techniques such as the meta viewport tag, responsive units, flexbox, media queries, and CSS frameworks like Bootstrap are used to craft websites that dynamically adapt to the varying needs of users on different devices and screen sizes.
