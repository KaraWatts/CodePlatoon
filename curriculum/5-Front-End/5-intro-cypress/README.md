# Testing in React.js

## What are we Trying to Achieve

By learning about front-end testing and how to test React applications with Cypress on Vite + React, you are aiming to enhance the quality and reliability of your web applications. Front-end testing equips you with the skills to systematically assess and validate the functionality of your user interfaces, ensuring they work as intended and remain bug-free. Specifically, using Cypress with Vite + React allows you to create efficient end-to-end tests and integration tests for React components, helping you catch and address issues early in the development process, leading to improved user experiences, increased developer confidence, and a smoother deployment process for your web applications.

## Lectures and Assignments

- [Lecture - Why Testing?](./1-why-testing.md)
- [Lecture - Cypress](./2-cypress-react.md)
  - [Assignment - Cypress](.) Create a React project that utilizes the Cypress test suite. Use this assignment to get familiarized with the different types of commands and tests you can run within [cypress](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/component-testing/react/examples)
  - [Assignment - Refactor](.) One of the most important skills as a Software Engineer is being able to refactor code. Take the time to go over this modules assignments and apply the following concepts:
    - Ensure proper use of React Hooks (useState, useEffect || Don't use the JS DOM)
    - Isolate behavior (Create React Components with Props)
    - Don't Repeat Yourself (Do you have any repeated code?)
    - Add styling to components (Apply TailwindCSS or BootStrap)
    - Add test suites to reinforce requirements (Utilize Cypress to create tests that reinforce assignment requirements)
