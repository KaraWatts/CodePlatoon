# Node, NPM, and JS

## What are we Trying to Accomplish?

By learning about Node, NPM, ES6, mapping, filtering, object destructuring, and how to create a simple React environment, you are aiming to gain a foundational understanding of the tools and concepts necessary for modern web development. Node and NPM empower you to manage dependencies and work with server-side JavaScript, while ES6, mapping, and filtering introduce more efficient and expressive ways to work with data. Object destructuring enhances your ability to work with complex data structures, and creating a React environment prepares you to build interactive and dynamic user interfaces, forming the basis for developing robust web applications in a professional and efficient manner.
