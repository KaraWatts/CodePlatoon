# Front-End Development

## What are we trying to accomplish?

You will learn modern frontend development - using React.js and Javascript to write single-page-apps (web apps) that run in the browser. You will be able to build the "front end" (the part of the web app running in the browser, the user interface, that people actually interact with) of a web app for common use cases and be able to get and send data from third party API's.

Many of the websites / apps you interact with in your browser on a daily basis - from Gmail to Facebook to Wikipedia to Youtube - are built using these same open-source technologies and frontend architecture patterns.

You will be able to explain how these applications are built and why they're built that way, and, become proficient in building them yourself using industry best practices.
