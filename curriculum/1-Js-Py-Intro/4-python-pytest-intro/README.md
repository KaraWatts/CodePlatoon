# Intro to Python and TDD with Pytest

## What are we trying to accomplish?

By the end of this lecture you'll learn how to utilize `Pythons` elegant syntax and rich ecosystem to solve functional algorithms while exercise your critical solving abilities. Additionally, you'll learn how to utilize the `pytest`testing framework to explore and develop your skills with Test Driven Development.
