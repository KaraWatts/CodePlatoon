# Intro to JS, Python, the Command Line, and Git

## What are we trying to accomplish?

Modern software development is complex, and, writing code professionally requires using some specific tools and workflows. And while software is still a young field, there is a rich legacy of tools and programs that have become "standard" knowledge and which you can take advantage of.

You now will start learning how to use these professional tools, both to meet the standards of the industry and to improve your own productivity, workflow, and the quality of the software you write.

You will also dive deeper in the Python and Javascript programming languages and begin to learn best practices for both those languages.

Most of all, you will begin to learn your "workbench" - your computer. Not only will you go deeper into Python, JS, and programming generally, but you will begin learning how to customize and configure your "dev environment" - your own machine.
Lastly, we will cover the two most commonly used languages in the industry along with their respective popular test frameworks. This will allow you to understand and exercise Test Driven Development concepts and fundamentals to help you become an essential tool for the industry.
