# Full Stack Application

## What are we trying to accomplish?

By learning about the full stack life cycle, Django CORS headers, and utilizing Axios to communicate with your Django API, you are striving to master the end-to-end process of web development. This encompasses understanding the complete journey of a web request, from the user interface in React to the backend server built with Django. Proficiency in Django CORS headers ensures secure cross-origin resource sharing, facilitating smooth communication between your React front-end and Django back-end. Leveraging Axios empowers you to create efficient and seamless data exchanges, enabling you to build robust, interactive, and responsive web applications that deliver a superior user experience while maintaining data integrity and security.
