# App Users

You have the next big thing on the interwebs.  But a thing isn't anything without users.  In your application, users can sign up with all kinds of valuable personal information like `name`, `email address`, `driver's licence number`, you name it.

1. Write a `User` class that can handle your growing application's needs.
2. Create a few users.
