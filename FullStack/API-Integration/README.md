# API Integration

Find an api that interests you from the [API List](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis) and build a simple web page that utilizes fetch to call the api and then displays the data on the page. Get creative and have fun with it! :)

> Some of these API's have authentication included in them, we have not covered authentication with API's yet so feel free to avoid them at this point of the curriculum.
