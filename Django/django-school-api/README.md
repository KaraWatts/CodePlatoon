# School API

By the end of this assignment you will have a fully serviceable CRUD API with user authentication capabilities that will allow School staff to easily manage students and schollastic equipment.

## Student Model

In this assignment we will create a Student Django Model with the following fields

| field            | required |type |example data                    |
| ----------------- | -----|-------|------------- |
| name | True |string | John W. Watson |
| student_email | True | string(email) | johnnyBoy@school.com |
| personal_email | False | string(email) | johnnyBoy@gmail.com |
| locker_number | True |int |137 |
| locker_combination | True |string |37-68-98 |
| good_student | True |boolean | True |

## Django Set Up

Creating and activating VENV

```bash
  #creating venv
  python -m venv <name_of_env>

  #activating venv
  source <name_of_env>/bin/activate
```

Installing Django and starting a project with an app

```bash
    #installing Django
    pip install django

    #creating project
    django-admin startproject school_proj .

    #creating student app
    python manage.py startapp student_app
```

Creating Database

```bash
    createdb school_db
```

**Don't forget to add the app under the `INSTALLED_APPS` section in `settings.py` and changing from sqlite to postgresql with a database name!**

Installing Psycopg3 to speak with PostgreSQL

```bash
  pip install "psycopg[binary]"
```

Once the Student Model is completed makemigrations and migrate to the school_db

```bash
  python manage.py makemigrations
  python manage.py migrate
```

## Running Tests

Replace the `test.py` file inside your app with the `test.py` file already attached to this repository.

Now you can run the test suite by typing the following

```bash
  python manage.py test
```

- `.` means a test passed
- `E` means an unhandled error populated on a test
- `F` means a test completely failed to run
