## Considerations

* Take note of how the 'bottles' turns to 'bottle' at the right time
* You can certainly use `while`, `for`, `forEach`, and various other built in methods

## Challenge Yourself

* Make your code able to take in and account for any bottle amount
* Refactor your code so it doesn't use any loops or iteration whatsoever
