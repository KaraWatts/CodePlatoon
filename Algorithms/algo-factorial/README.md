# Factorial Challenge

## Usage

## Usage

To run `factorial.js` itself:

```sh
node factorial.js
```

To run `factorialSpec.js`:

```sh
node factorialSpec.js
```

In this exercise you are going to create a function that takes a number parameter and returns the factorial of it.

Factorial has a very specific definition. Learn more [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial#Definition). As an overview though, a factorial is the result of multiplying a sequence of descending numbers down to 0. Factorials are only defined for non-negative integer numbers. This definition includes zero. Though 0! is equal to 1, so treat it as an edge case.

```js
factorial(0); // 1
factorial(1); // 1
factorial(2); // 2 * 1
factorial(3); // 3 * 2 * 1
factorial(4); // 4 * 3 * 2 * 1
// ...etc
```
